# IR-Spotify

Hello! Ever since I got an Infrared (IR) controller, I've wanted to make a project with it. At first I thought of 

## Instructions

To make this work, you need a Raspberry Pi, an IR controller & receiver, and an external speaker. The Raspberry Pi gets input from the IR receiver (which itself gets input from the user pressing keys on the IR controller), and uses the Spotify API to execute a command based on the input.

### Setup

Follow the following [guide](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/blob/2.22.1/TUTORIAL.md) until Step 2. to start using the Spotify API.

Then, manipulate my files:
- Download the files from this repsitory
- Fill out the credentials.py file
- Upload your files to your Raspberry Pi (USB stick, file sharing, email... whatever suits you best)
- Install the package 'Spotipy' on your Raspberry Pi



### Running the program
